# Angular

- [x] login form prefilled with junk
- [x] redirect to login for some reason
- [x] app name should redirect to home page
- [ ] user list should use angular cards?
- [ ] user detail page could use an md-card probably
- [ ] write .css instead of styling inside html (?)
- [ ] if no user logged in, card should link to login

- [ ] Sometimes editing multiple rows. Provide a table view of this? (the md table lib I added will be A+ for this)
- [ ] autosave
- [ ] autojudging rules. Some students make transfer annotations between
      different strains of the same species wherein proteins encode literally
      the same gene. This should be immediately rejected.

# Django

- [ ] django should reject POST requests for GAF submission if not logged in
